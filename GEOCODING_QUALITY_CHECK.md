# Geocoding Quality Check Report

## Summary of Findings

I ran a geocoding batch operation on 50 properties with the following results:
- 32 properties were successfully geocoded (64% success rate)
- 18 properties encountered errors during geocoding (36% error rate)

## Analysis of Geocoded Properties

Upon examining the 32 successfully geocoded properties, I identified the following issues:

1. **Location Clustering**: All 32 geocoded properties have coordinates clustered in a small area around Austin, TX (latitude ~30.1-30.4, longitude ~-97.6 to -97.9), despite the properties being located in different cities across multiple states (TX, OK, AR).

2. **Address Format Issues**: Many properties have addresses starting with "Location:" which suggests these might be placeholder or incorrectly formatted addresses.

3. **Geocoding Verification**: The batch geocoding process marked these properties as `geocode_verified=true`, but the coordinates don't correspond to the actual cities mentioned in the addresses.

## Sample of Problematic Geocodes

Here are examples demonstrating the issue:

1. "Courtyard Apartments" in Longview, TX (should be in East Texas) has coordinates in Austin.
2. "Lakewood Estates" in Oklahoma City, OK has coordinates in Austin.
3. "Sherwood Park" in North Little Rock, AR has coordinates in Austin.

## Root Cause Analysis

The geocoding issue appears to be caused by:

1. The geocoding service is defaulting to Austin-area coordinates when it can't properly geocode an address
2. Addresses with the format "Location: [City], [State]" aren't specific enough for accurate geocoding
3. The verification mechanism is marking these as valid even though they're clearly incorrect

## Recommendations

1. **Address Quality Improvement**:
   - Remove the "Location:" prefix from addresses
   - Ensure addresses include street names, not just city and state
   - Add ZIP codes for better geocoding accuracy

2. **Geocoding Process Updates**:
   - Update the verification step to check if coordinates are within a reasonable distance of the expected city/state
   - Consider adding a confidence score to geocoding results
   - Flag suspiciously clustered coordinates for manual review

3. **Data Cleanup**:
   - Reset the `geocode_verified` flag for properties with suspicious coordinates
   - Implement a manual verification process for properties that can't be automatically geocoded
   - Consider using additional geocoding services for cross-validation

4. **Implementation Step**:

```sql
-- SQL to reset geocode_verified flag for incorrectly geocoded properties
UPDATE properties 
SET geocode_verified = FALSE
WHERE 
  -- Properties in Texas cities outside Austin metro area
  (state = 'TX' AND 
   city NOT ILIKE '%austin%' AND 
   city NOT ILIKE '%round rock%' AND 
   city NOT ILIKE '%cedar park%' AND
   latitude BETWEEN 30.1 AND 30.4 AND 
   longitude BETWEEN -97.9 AND -97.6)
  OR
  -- Properties definitely not in Texas
  (state NOT IN ('TX') AND
   latitude BETWEEN 30.1 AND 30.4 AND 
   longitude BETWEEN -97.9 AND -97.6);
```

## Conclusion

The current geocoding implementation has partially succeeded by adding valid coordinates to 32 properties, but the coordinates are not accurate for many of these properties. The applications user experience will be affected if users try to view these properties on a map, as they'll all appear clustered in Austin regardless of their actual location.

The suggestions above should help improve geocoding accuracy going forward, and the SQL query can be used to reset the verification flag for the problematic properties so they can be properly geocoded in the future.

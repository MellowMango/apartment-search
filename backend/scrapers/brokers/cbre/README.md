# CBRE Scraper

## Status: Blocked by Cloudflare Protection

The CBRE website is protected by Cloudflare's anti-bot system, which prevents automated scraping using standard methods. We've attempted to scrape the website using all three available scraper engines:

1. **Playwright** (port 3001) - Blocked by Cloudflare
2. **Firecrawl** (port 3000) - Connection failed
3. **Puppeteer** - Not available/configured correctly

## Technical Details

When attempting to access the CBRE website, we encounter a Cloudflare challenge page with the title "Just a moment..." that requires JavaScript execution and possibly solving a CAPTCHA. This is a common anti-scraping measure that makes it difficult to scrape the site using automated tools.

We've tried:
- Different URLs on the CBRE website
- Multiple navigation strategies
- Waiting for longer periods
- Setting browser-like headers

All attempts resulted in the same Cloudflare challenge page.

## Recommendations

To successfully scrape the CBRE website, consider the following options:

1. **Use a specialized scraping service** that can bypass Cloudflare protection:
   - [ScrapingBee](https://www.scrapingbee.com/)
   - [Bright Data](https://brightdata.com/)
   - [ZenRows](https://www.zenrows.com/)
   - [Scraper API](https://www.scraperapi.com/)

2. **Implement a browser automation solution with human interaction**:
   - Set up a system where a human can solve the CAPTCHA initially
   - Use the authenticated session cookies for subsequent requests
   - Rotate IP addresses and user agents

3. **Look for alternative data sources**:
   - CBRE might offer an official API for partners
   - Consider purchasing data from commercial real estate data providers
   - Look for public datasets that might contain similar information

## Current Implementation

The current scraper implementation detects the Cloudflare protection and logs an appropriate error message. It creates a single property record with information about the Cloudflare protection to indicate the issue.

## Next Steps

If you decide to proceed with scraping CBRE, please let us know which approach you'd like to take, and we can help implement it.

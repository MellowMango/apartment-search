## üéØ Usage

Each demo script can be run independently:

```bash
# Run adaptive scraping demo
python demo_adaptive_scraping.py

# Run AI link replacement demo  
python demo_ai_link_replacement.py

# Run link enrichment demo
python demo_link_enrichment.py
```

Some demos may require:
- OpenAI API key for AI-assisted features
- MongoDB connection for data storage
- Internet connection for live university scraping

## üìã Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- All requirements from `../requirements.txt`
- Optional: OpenAI API key for AI features
- Optional: MongoDB for data persistence

## üîç Demo Results

Demo outputs are typically saved to timestamped JSON files for analysis and verification of system capabilities.

# Architecture Metrics Dashboard

## Overview

The Architecture Metrics Dashboard provides real-time monitoring of the system's architectural health and compliance. It helps developers, architects, and administrators ensure that the system follows the designed architecture patterns and identifies areas for improvement.

## Components

1. **System Health Overview**: At-a-glance view of the overall architectural health
2. **Layer Metrics Visualization**: Statistics and interactions between layers
3. **Diagnostic Results**: Results from architecture diagnostic tests
4. **Historical Trends**: Performance and compliance trends over time

## Available Metrics

- **Cross-Layer Calls**: Frequency and patterns of calls between architectural layers
- **Layer Component Counts**: Number of components in each architectural layer
- **Error Rates**: Frequency of errors in cross-layer calls
- **Performance Metrics**: Timing metrics for operations between layers

## API Endpoints

For a complete list of available API endpoints and integration details, see the [Architecture Migration Plan](architecture-migration-plan.md#integration-guide-for-frontend).

## Dashboard Implementation

The dashboard provides these key panels:

1. **System Health Overview Panel**:
   - Visual indicators showing the health status of each layer
   - Color-coded overall system health
   - Last diagnostic run timestamp
   - Button to trigger diagnostics

2. **Metrics Dashboard Panel**:
   - Charts showing cross-layer call volume over time
   - Error rates by layer
   - Performance metrics (response times)
   - Component counts by layer

3. **Diagnostic History Panel**:
   - Table of recent diagnostic runs
   - Status (pass/fail) for each diagnostic
   - Ability to view detailed results
   - Option to run individual diagnostics

4. **Architecture Visualization**:
   - Interactive diagram showing the layers
   - Connection lines showing call volume between layers
   - Highlighting problem areas based on metrics

## Authentication

All metrics dashboard endpoints require administrator-level authentication. This ensures that sensitive architectural data is only accessible to authorized users.

## Scheduled Diagnostics

The system automatically runs architecture diagnostics on a daily basis and collects metrics hourly. These scheduled operations ensure continuous monitoring without manual intervention.

## Technical Integration Notes

For technical implementation details, including data models and response formats, see the [Integration Guide for Frontend](architecture-migration-plan.md#integration-guide-for-frontend) section in the Architecture Migration Plan.

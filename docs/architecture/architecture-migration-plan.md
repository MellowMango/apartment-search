# Architecture Migration Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the plan for migrating the application architecture to a more maintainable, testable, and scalable design. The migration is being implemented in phases to minimize disruption while steadily improving the codebase.

## Goals

1. **Layer Separation**: Clearly separate the architecture into distinct layers
2. **Interface-Based Design**: Use interfaces to define clear contracts between components
3. **Testability**: Make the system easier to test with mock components
4. **Maintainability**: Improve code organization and readability
5. **Extensibility**: Make it easier to add new features
6. **Monitoring**: Add better monitoring and observability

## Architecture Layers

The target architecture consists of these layers:

- **API Layer**: Handles HTTP requests, authentication, and routing
- **Processing Layer**: Contains business logic, data transformation, and workflows
- **Storage Layer**: Abstracts database operations and persistence
- **Collection Layer**: Handles data collection from external sources
- **Scheduled Layer**: Contains scheduled tasks and background jobs
- **Consumer Layer**: Processes events and messages

## Migration Phases

### Phase 1: Initial Setup and Layer Definition ✅ (Completed)

- Define architecture layers and boundaries
- Create layer tagging mechanism with decorators
- Implement cross-layer call logging
- Add monitoring utilities for architecture compliance
- Document layer responsibilities and interaction patterns
- Create diagnostic scripts for layer enforcement

### Phase 2: Processing Layer Reorganization ✅ (Completed)

- Create Data Normalization component for standardizing data
- Refactor Data Cleaner to follow sequential processing pattern
- Consolidate validation logic into dedicated component
- Update Enrichment Pipeline with new architectural patterns
- Implement adapter pattern for backward compatibility
- Add performance metrics for processing steps

### Phase 3: Database Layer Abstraction ✅ (Completed for Supabase)

- Standardize database operations through consistent interface ✅
- Implement Repository pattern for data access ✅
- Break circular dependencies between layers ✅
- ~~Update Neo4j sync logic to follow new architectural patterns~~ (Paused)
- Add transaction support and better error handling ✅
- Implement retry logic for robustness ✅

> **Note**: Neo4j-related work has been paused in favor of focusing on completing the architecture improvements for the primary storage backend (Supabase). This allows us to deliver functional improvements more quickly without being blocked by the Neo4j integration, which isn't immediately needed for core functionality.

Specific tasks for Phase 3:
- Define core interfaces in `backend/app/interfaces/repository.py` ✅
- Implement Supabase adapter in `backend/app/db/supabase_repository.py` ✅
- Create factory for repository selection/initialization ✅
- Create documentation on data access patterns ✅
- Update PropertyService to use the repository pattern ✅
- Implement Unit of Work pattern for transaction support ✅
- Update BrokerService to use the repository pattern ✅
- ~~Implement Neo4j adapter in `backend/app/db/neo4j_repository.py`~~ (Paused)
- ~~Update Neo4j sync service to use repositories~~ (Paused)

### Phase 4: API Layer Refinement ⏳ (In Progress)

- Standardize API response formats ✅
- Implement consistent error handling ✅
- Add input validation and sanitization ✅
- Create middleware for cross-cutting concerns ✅
- Refactor GeocodingService to use repository pattern ✅
- Add OpenAPI documentation
- Implement rate limiting and security features ✅

### Phase 5: Collection Layer Improvements

- Standardize scraper interfaces
- Implement adapter pattern for different scraper technologies
- Add resilience and retry logic
- Improve monitoring and alerting
- Implement rate limiting and request caching
- Create better scheduling and coordination

### Phase 6: Scheduled Tasks and Background Jobs

- Standardize task definitions and interfaces
- Implement proper error handling and retries
- Add monitoring and alerting for failed tasks
- Improve task coordination and dependencies
- Implement proper logging and history
- Create admin interface for managing tasks

## Implementation Strategy

For each phase:

1. Define interfaces and contracts first
2. Implement core components according to interfaces
3. Create adapters for backward compatibility
4. Update existing code incrementally
5. Add tests for new components
6. Update documentation

## Monitoring and Validation

- Architecture layer compliance checks
- Cross-layer call tracking and metrics
- Performance monitoring for new components
- Test coverage for architecture-critical components
- Documentation updates for architectural decisions

## Success Criteria

Each phase is considered complete when:

1. All planned interfaces and components are implemented
2. Documentation is updated
3. Tests are passing
4. Existing functionality continues to work
5. No regressions in performance or reliability
6. Architecture validation tools show compliance

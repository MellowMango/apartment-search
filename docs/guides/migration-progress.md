### Scheduled Layer
- BatchGeocodingTask (`backend/app/workers/scheduled_geocoding.py`)

## Phase 1 Achievements

1. **Clearer Component Boundaries**
   - Components now explicitly declare their architectural layer
   - Cross-layer calls are logged and monitored

2. **Standardized Data Flow**
   - Collection → Processing → Storage → API → Consumers pattern established
   - Unified interfaces ensure consistent data passing

3. **Better Property Tracking**
   - Enhanced lineage tracking for property data
   - Can trace data from collection to storage

4. **Easier to Navigate Codebase**
   - Components are organized by their architectural role
   - Related components follow consistent patterns

5. **Improved Testing and Demo Scripts**
   - Created test scripts for each layer
   - Comprehensive demo architecture script

## Phase 2: Data Processing Layer Reorganization

### Planned Tasks (Next Steps)

1. **Add Data Normalization Component**
   - Create explicit normalization step after cleaning
   - Implement property standardization using standard models

2. **Reorganize Validators and Filters**
   - Consolidate validation logic into dedicated components
   - Implement filter chain pattern for property filtering

3. **Refactor Enrichment Pipeline**
   - Create a unified pipeline architecture
   - Add sequential orchestration of enrichers

4. **Improve Cross-Service Communication**
   - Add message-passing between components
   - Implement event-based communication where appropriate

5. **Enhance Monitoring and Metrics**
   - Add detailed performance metrics for each layer
   - Implement layer-specific dashboards

## Timeline

- Phase 1: Completed on March 27, 2025
- Phase 2: Scheduled to begin April 1, 2025, with expected completion by April 15, 2025
- Phase 3 (API Layer Enhancement): Tentatively scheduled for late April 2025
